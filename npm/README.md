## Quick Start

[Get started with the Quick Start Guide](https://docs.apiverve.com/quickstart)

The ASCII85 Encoder API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/ascii85encoder](https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/ascii85encoder).
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

```javascript
const ascii85encoderAPI = require('@apiverve/ascii85encoder');
const api = new ascii85encoderAPI({
    api_key: '[YOUR_API_KEY]'
});
```

## Usage

---

### Perform Request

Using the API is simple. All you have to do is make a request. The API will return a response with the data you requested.

```javascript
var query = {
  text: "Hello World",
  action: "encode",
  format: "standard"
};

api.execute(query, function (error, data) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

---

### Using Promises

You can also use promises to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
var query = {
  text: "Hello World",
  action: "encode",
  format: "standard"
};

api.execute(query)
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

---

### Using Async/Await

You can also use async/await to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
async function makeRequest() {
    var query = {
  text: "Hello World",
  action: "encode",
  format: "standard"
};

    try {
        const data = await api.execute(query);
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```

---

## Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "error": null,
  "data": {
    "original_text": "Hello World",
    "encoded": "87cURD]i,\"Ebo7",
    "format": "standard",
    "original_length": 11,
    "encoded_length": 14,
    "compression_ratio": "127.27%"
  }
}
```
